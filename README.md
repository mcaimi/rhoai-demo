# RedHat Openshift AI Demo Collection

WIP demos running on Openshift AI. Currently *very* work in progress and *very* imcomplete.

Notebooks folder contents:

- (1) Prepare S3 buckets and interact with HuggingFace to download and upload model checkpoints
- (2) Use langchain to tokenize and embed a database of additional information and interact with ChromaDB to store embeddings
- (3) Download the full Mistral-7B model from HuggingFace, test inference, quantize the model, save the quantized model and upload the resulting checkpoint to S3
- (4) (WIP) Interact with the model via vLLM

## TODO

- Finish demo code
- Upload more demos
